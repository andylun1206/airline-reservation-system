For team coding style, we will use the default coding style 
specified by the autoformat tool in Android Studio (Ctrl + Alt + L).

Database tables: User, Flights, Airports, Airlines, BookedFlights
	Split information into multiple tables to prevent redundant information storage.
	Table Flights will reference User, Airports, and Airlines.
	Table BookedFlights will reference User and Flights.

For iteration 1, we will implement the GUI for the big user story: searching for flights.
This story was chosen because in order to view and compare flights, we first need to be
able to search for flights.

The person responsible for writing a given class will also be responsible for writing the 
tests for that class.

We will use the GitHub flow model.
